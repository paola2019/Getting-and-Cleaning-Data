### Getting-and-Cleaning-Data 
### Peer-graded Assignment

In this repo there are three files:
#### _run_analysis.R_, that does the following:
1. Downloads the data
2. Creates all necesary data frames
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#### _CodeBook.md_, that describes all the variables, the data, and any transformations or work to clean up the data. 
#### _TidyData2.txt_, that contains the tidy data set created in step 7 of the _run_analysis.R_ code.
